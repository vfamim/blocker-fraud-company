# Intro 

## The Blocker Fraud Company 

**Blocker Fraud Company** is a specialized company in fraud detection on financial transactions through mobile devices. It has the "Blocker Fraud" service, which guarantee the block of fraudulent transactions.

The company business model is service type, with monetization made by performance of the provided service. The user pay a fixed fee on the fraud detection success.

## Expansion Strategy in Brazil 

Aiming to expand business in Brazil it has adopted the following strategy:

- The company will receive 25% of the value of each transaction detected as *fraud*.  
- The company will receive 5% of the value of each transaction detected as *fraud*, but the transaction is *legitimate*.  
- The company will return 100% of the value to the customer, for each transaction detected as legitimate, however a transaction is a fraud.  

## Context 

There is a lack of public available data sets on financial services and specially in the emerging mobile money transactions domain. Financial data sets are important to many researchers and in particular to us performing research in the domain of fraud detection. Part of the problem is the intrinsically private nature of financial transactions, that leads to no publicly available datasets.

We present a synthetic data set generated using the simulator called PaySim as an approach to such a problem. PaySim uses aggregated data from the private data set to generate a synthetic data set that resembles the normal operation of transactions and injects malicious behavior to later evaluate the performance of fraud detection methods.

## Content 

PaySim simulates mobile money transactions based on a sample of real transactions extracted from one month of financial logs from a mobile money service implemented in an African country. The original logs were provided by a multinational company, who is the provider of the mobile financial service which is currently running in more than 14 countries all around the world.

This synthetic data set is scaled down 1/4 of the original data set and it is created just for Kaggle.

## Goal 

1. What is the model's *precision* and *accuracy*?  

2. How reliable is the model in classifying transactions as *legitimate* or *fraudulent*?  

3. What is the expected billing by the company if we classify 100% of data transactions with the model?  

4. What is the loss expected by company in case of model failure ?  

5. What is the profit expected by the **Blocker Fraud Company** when using model?

## Data 

Data provided by Kaggle: [Synthetic Financial Datasets for Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/ntnu-testimon/paysim1)

## Analysis 

This solution will use descriptive statistics and data visualization to find key figures in understanding the distribution, count, and relationship between variables. Since the goal of the project to make predictions on the fraud's detection, classification algorithms from the supervised learning family of machine learning models will be implemented.

## Evaluation 

The project will conclude with the evaluation of the machine learning model selected with a validation data set. The output of the predictions can be checked through a confusion matrix, and metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 and Kappa scores.

| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| step           | maps a unit of time in the real world. In this case 1 step is 1 hour of time. Total steps 744 (30 days simulation). |
| type           | Transaction type (CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT and TRANSFER) |
| amount         | amount of the transaction in local currency                  |
| nameOrig       | customer who started the transaction                         |
| oldbalanceOrg  | initial balance before the transaction                       |
| newbalanceOrig | new balance after the transaction                            |
| nameDest       | customer who is the recipient of the transaction             |
| oldbalanceDest | initial balance recipient before the transaction. Note that there is not information for customers that start with M (Merchants) |
| newbalanceDest | new balance recipient after the transaction. Note that there is not information for customers that start with M (Merchants) |
| isFraud        | This is the transactions made by the fraudulent agents inside the  simulation.

# 5.0. Final Model: Random Forest Classifier

It's time to improve our model using GridsearchCV to find the best parameters. In grid search the process of performing hyper parameter tuning in order to  determine the optimal values for a given model. Note that there is no way to know in advance the best  values for hyper parameters so ideally, we need to try all possible  values to know the optimal values. Doing this manually could take a  considerable amount of time and resources and thus we use GridSearchCV  to automate the tuning of hyper parameters. GridSearchCV tries all the combinations of the values passed in the  dictionary and evaluates the model for each combination using the Cross-Validation method.

## 11.3.  What is the expected billing by the company if we classify 100% of data transactions with the model?

```
The company will receive $3,011,586,048.00 dua to transaction truly detected as fraud.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The company will receive $421,231.81 due to transaction detected as fraud, but actually legitimate.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The company will give back $10,071,736.00 due to transactions detected as legitimate, but actually fraud.
```

## 11.4. What is the loss expected by company in case of model failure?
